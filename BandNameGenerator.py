#Program to generate your new band name.
'''This script will ask two questions, will input both and combine to form some really lame Band
name in a really lame and straight forward way. But hey, this is my 1st python project so, cheers.!'''

#giving city name into the variable x to contain
x = input("What is the name of the city you're from? " '\n')

#giving pet name into the variable y to contain
y = input("What is the name of your pet ? " '\n')

#the band name is just x with y beside and an empty space added in between
print("Your new band could be called ", x + " " + y)
